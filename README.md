# ProjectFinancer

## A simple cross-platform mobile app that serves as an easy to use way to log your finances

_This is also me just learning react native as I slowly add features to this app_

**So far with this app you can:**

- Add money to your current balance
- Deduct money from your current balance
- Specify the amount to add/deduct, what it is, the relevant date and category
- Store all transactions in a local database

**Possible future updates include (but are not limited to):**

- Full light/dark theme support include support for following system theme
- Support for multiple accounts with separate balances (like maybe a savings account etc)
- Storing transactions in the cloud
- Option to include user's current location (stored as coordinates) when adding a new transaction
- Daily push notifications to remind user to add any new transactions
- Lots of design stuff
  ... and more!

Some notices:

- Currently the theme does follow the system theme so dark mode does work but not all the elements support it yet so I'd just set my phone to light theme while using the app for now
- It's possible that this app looks wildly different on iPhone or that some elements don't even work on it.... _I wouldn't know as I don't own an iOS or macOS device_
- **NONE OF THE DESIGN IS FINAL!!!!** For now I'm focusing on adding the back-end features and making sure they are stable enough before I start worrying about the front-end UI/UX
